<h1> SPEEDTEST SHEETS </h1>
<h4>
Checks the wifi upload and download speed every time the set amount is reached over and over, it gets logged into a .xlxs sheet. <br>
  - Make sure the time is imported in seconds!<br>
  - You can not open the excel sheet while the code is running! (if you need to see copy it)<br>
  - Measured in MB/s
  - To start, you need to install the librarys in requirements.txt but after just launch the .py file!

NOTE: This was just a small project I dont know if I plan on expanding it at all!
